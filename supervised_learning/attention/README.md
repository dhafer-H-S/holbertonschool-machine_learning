Attention
Overview
This project explores various aspects of attention mechanisms, transformers, and their applications in natural language processing (NLP). Attention mechanisms have revolutionized the field of NLP by allowing models to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, enhancing performance in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.

What is the attention mechanism?
The attention mechanism allows neural networks to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when making predictions. It enables the model to selectively focus on relevant information, improving its performance in various tasks.

How to apply attention to RNNs
Attention mechanisms can be applied to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by modifying the standard RNN architecture to incorporate attention mechanisms. This allows RNNs to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence at each time step.

What is a transformer?
The transformer is a type of neural network architecture introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. It utilizes self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, making it highly efficient for sequence processing tasks.

How to create an encoder-decoder transformer model
An encoder-decoder transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward networks. The encoder processes the input sequence, while the decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representations.

What is GPT?
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a type of transformer-based language model introduced by OpenAI. It is trained on large amounts of text data using a self-supervised learning approach and can generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

What is BERT?
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is another transformer-based language model introduced by Google. It is pre-trained on large corpora of text using a self-supervised learning objective and has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks.

What is self-supervised learning?
Self-supervised learning is a learning paradigm where a model is trained to predict certain properties of its input data without explicit supervision. It is often used in pre-training large neural network models on unlabeled data, allowing them to learn useful representations.

How to use BERT for specific NLP tasks
BERT can be fine-tuned for specific NLP tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering by adding task-specific output layers and fine-tuning the pre-trained model on task-specific labeled data.

What is SQuAD? GLUE?
SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) is a popular benchmark dataset for question answering tasks. It consists of questions posed on a set of Wikipedia articles, with corresponding answer spans within the articles.

GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) is a benchmark dataset comprising a diverse set of NLP tasks, including sentence similarity, textual entailment, and sentiment analysis. It serves as a standardized evaluation benchmark for assessing the performance of NLP models across different tasks.
