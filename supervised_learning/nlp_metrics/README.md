Natural Language Processing - Evaluation Metrics
Overview
This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) evaluation metrics, specifically the BLEU and ROUGE scores, as well as perplexity. The goal is to understand the applications of NLP, learn about these evaluation metrics, and implement functions to calculate them.

Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should be able to:

Explain the applications of natural language processing.
Understand and calculate the BLEU score.
Understand and calculate the ROUGE score.
Understand the concept of perplexity.
Decide when to use one evaluation metric over another.
