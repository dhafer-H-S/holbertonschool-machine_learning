Centroid: The center of a cluster. It represents the "average" of the points in that cluster.

Euclidean Distance: A measure of how far two points are from each other in space. For example, the Euclidean distance between two points on a 2D plane is the straight line between them.

Iterations: K-means works by repeating the steps of assigning data points to clusters and updating the centroids. It keeps doing this until the centroids no longer change (or for a fixed number of iterations).

Cluster Assignment: For each data point, we figure out which centroid is closest to it. The data point is assigned to the nearest centroid.
